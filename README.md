Let me introduce this is a Content Management System related to basketball.

why should I do this?

1. First of all, I am an avid basketball powder. Basketball is my favorite, so I donâ€™t know what other motivations will make me do this.

2. Secondly, I want to improve my technical level. With such a clear direction, I can expand to all aspects of basketball. In the process, I hope I can make it what I want.

3. Finally, I will introduce the history of the NBA teams, the player's information from several modules, the All-Star and Hall of Fame players in NBA history, as well as basketball shoes and basketball uniforms, etc.

I hope everyone can like my project. If you are interested in, you can join me and let me continue to learn and work hard to achieve the great goal of the whole stack engineer.
